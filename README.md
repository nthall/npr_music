# NPR Music

The goal of this project is to scrape the NPR archives for the music that plays between segments on *All Things Considered* and *Morning Edition*, and grab EchoNest data for the associated tracks. Then, play with it and see if any fun patterns emerge from the data, and if so, make a little frontend for that. So far, it kinda scrapes, just not very well.
